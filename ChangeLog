	* ucf.1: srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-14
		  Document various extensions optionally used by ucf to
		  store copies of versions of configuration files ucf is
		  working with.

	* ucf (safe_dest_file):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-12
		  Improve the handling of finding a sensible pager.  This
		  now handles a messed up /etc/alternatives/paper
		  setting. Also included sensible pager as an
		  alternative, and fall back to /bin/more if
		  needed.  Also, allow for readlink failures.

2006-04-11  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* ucf.1: srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-8 Added
		  documentation for the --state-dir option. 

	* ucfr.1: Documentation for the new command ucfr

	* ucfr: New file. Associates, and disassociates, a package name
		  with configuration files.

	* Makefile (check):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-8 Added
		  a check for ucfr 
		  (install):
			  srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-8
			  Install ucfr and manual page as well 

	* ucf (NEW_SUFFIX):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-7 Added
		  new variables to hold the suffix we use todenote the
		  {maintainers, old, new} versions of a file. Used to be
		  dpkg-{dist,old,new}, now it is ucf-{dist,old,new}.

	* ucf (newsum): srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-4
		  Added support for side-by-side diffs, This is very
		  similar to doing a standard diff, apart from calling
		  sdiff instead (and change the option switches around as
		  needed. 

2005-09-01  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* examples/postrm:
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-2 only
		  use ucf if it is available 

2005-08-08  Manoj Srivastava  <srivasta@debian.org>

	* ucf: srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-1 Add code
		  to determine the value of UCF_FORCE_CONFFMISS, looking
		  at the command line, env variable, config file, or
		  default (the default being unset). No command line
		  option is currently available, but the underpinning are
		  there. Replace the destination file, if missing, and iff
		  the variable is set. 

	* ucf.1: srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--2.0--patch-1
		  Document  UCF_FORCE_CONFFMISS. This environment variable
		  is only  applicable when the installed destination file
		  does not exist (perhaps due to user removal),and forces
		  ucf to recreate the missing file (the default behaviour
		  is to honor the users wishes and not recreate the
		  locally deleted file).

	* ucf (safe_dest_file):
		  srivasta@debian.org--etch/ucf--devel--0.1--base-0 Well,
		  setting VERBOSE to 0 is the same as being quiet,
		  according to the man page. Unfortunately, the code
		  actually looked to see if VERBOSE was set (even if set
		  to 0). Now, we unset  VERBOSE if the user had set it to
		  0, making everyone happy.
