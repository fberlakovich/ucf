ucf (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/ucf.conf and ucf.conf(5) disagreed due to a typo in the man
    page. Fixed.                                             closes: Bug#135691
  * Added the ability for the developer to specify a single file with
    historical md5sums, instead of having to ship a directory populated
    with single line files for every configuration file in the
    package. This is now beginning to get reasonably complex ;-)

ucf (0.04) unstable; urgency=high

  * Hmm. Failed to replace the configuration file if the old file was a
    symbolic link to the new file (happened for gnus users). Thanks go to
    wsheets@sbcglobal.net for pointing this out.
