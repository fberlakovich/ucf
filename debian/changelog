  * No longer save conffiler.dpkg-old unless conffile had been
    modified. This should prevent the buildup of .dpkg-old cruft over
    time.                                                    closes: Bug#189520
  * Document the fact that --three-way first appeared in version 0.8 of
    ucf, which was the first version to hit sarge. The woody version of
    ucf shall not understand the --thre-way option.          closes: Bug#202431

  * A thinko in the logic for moving a old, locally modified configuration
    file to ucf could cause data loss.

  * Finally document the --three-way option. This has been in the code for
    a while now, and seems to be working, but was not documented so far.

ucf (0.10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Urk. Major breakage in ucf on upgrade; one loses
    /var/lib/ucf/hashfile, due to a major thinko. The downside is that the
    currently installed file shall be trated as the old version, and a
    wquestion shall be asked if the upstream file is different. This bad,
    but there is no real data loss; only a potential question asked on the
    next upgrade of packages using ucf.

ucf (0.08) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add a --purge option to ucf, to remove all hints about a configuration
    file from the hashfile. This fixes what happened if a package was
    purged, and reinstalled -- on purge the configuration file was
    removed, but it was still in ucf's database. On reinstall, since the
    upstream file had not changed, ucf did not copy it to the destination
    -- even though the destination file no longer existed. This is a major
    bugfix.                                                  closes: Bug#159015
  * Fix use of md5sum files, and manpage typo, thanks to a patch from
    Henrique de Moraes Holschuh <hmh@debian.org>.            closes: Bug#163229
  * ucf now has a rudimentary, experimental, and undocumented diff3
    capability. So, optionally, people can see a diff3 diff between the
    current file, the old file, and the new upstream version. Also, they
    can have the changes made in the upstream versions merged into the
    current file. This can be dangerous.

ucf (0.06) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added the ionformational script lcf and the associated man page.
  * Fixed a major thinko in ucf that could potentially trash the hashfile

ucf (0.05) unstable; urgency=low

  * /etc/ucf.conf and ucf.conf(5) disagreed due to a typo in the man
    page. Fixed.                                             closes: Bug#135691
  * Added the ability for the developer to specify a single file with
    historical md5sums, instead of having to ship a directory populated
    with single line files for every configuration file in the
    package. This is now beginning to get reasonably complex ;-)

ucf (0.04) unstable; urgency=high

  * Hmm. Failed to replace the configuration file if the old file was a
    symbolic link to the new file (happened for gnus users). Thanks go to
